# Market Basket Analysis using Machine Learning

      This repository contains code for performing Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using machine learning. Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to discover associations between items purchased by customers. This README provides instructions on how to run the code and lists the necessary dependencies

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the code for Market Basket Analysis on Windows.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

# Python (version 3.6 or higher) - Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
# Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended) - Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
# pip install notebook
   

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
 
   git clone https://github.com/Coding-86ALL/market-basket-analysis.git
    
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd market-basket-analysis
   
3. You can now run the code using Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.

## Usage

1. Open the `Market_Basket_Analysis.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.

2. Run the cells in the notebook one by one, following the comments and explanations provided in the code.

3. Customize the code as needed for your specific dataset and analysis requirements.

4. Analyze the results and discover association rules between items in the dataset.

## Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

- `Market_Basket_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for Market Basket Analysis.
- `data/`: Directory where you can place your dataset file (e.g., a CSV file).
- `results/`: Directory where the analysis results will be saved.

## Data

Place your dataset in the `data/` directory. The dataset should be in a tabular format, with each row representing a transaction, and each column representing items. Ensure that the items are encoded or labeled appropriately.

# Data source : (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basket-analysis)

## Algorithm

The code uses the Apriori algorithm to perform Market Basket Analysis. It discovers association rules and calculates support, confidence, and lift for itemsets in the dataset. You can customize the minimum support, minimum confidence, and other parameters in the code.

## Results

The analysis results, including discovered association rules and their statistics, will be saved in the `results/` directory. You can review and use these results for decision-making and recommendations.
